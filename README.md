# PyPrynt
It reads in data from our school's printers in a CSV format.  It provides a library of functions that run analyses on that data.  There is a TKinter GUI so that users can select which analyses they wish to see on the report. It then reads the users selections, runs those analyses, and puts the results into a .txt file for the user to read or print.
