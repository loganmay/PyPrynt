Rob's Note (11/21):

I figure with the GUI we can implement more things such as:
An option for a user to search entries that are greater than a certain number
An option for the user to select multiple printers and maybe compare there prints or something?
Maybe an option to see when a printer is most heavily used during the day, or which date it was used the most

If you already have something set up feel free to use that jsut let me know!
Thanks guys, sorry I couldn't come tonight...
-Rob

Logan's Note (11/22):

Moving forward:

- Refine the GUI to include search and sort (see Rob's Note)
- Look more into the faculty to student ratio and see if there is an interesting metric we can generate
regarding pages/print and the ratio of faculty to students
